        <h2>Learning IT</h2>
        <figcaption>I have been learning about IT since elementary school when we started block coding on code.org.
          Since
          then I
          learned some HTML, CSS, and Javascript in class, and some C# on my own. I've also learned some other assorted
          IT skills not related to programming but they are a lot less concrete. <figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure>
        <h2>Other</h2>
        <figcaption>I like playing video games, going on walks/biking, watching anime/tv, playing bass, and I hope to
          one day be fluent
          in
          german, form a band, and also play soccer. Listed below are some of my favorite pieces of media.<figcaption>

          alt="frieren beyond journeys end art">
        <figcaption>Frieren is one of my favorite animes because it's different and interesting. The fact that the
          names of a lot of characters and places are German is a plus.</figcaption>

          alt="hollow knight art">
        <figcaption>Hollow knight is usually very fun and can get difficult at times. Nightmare King Grimm was one
          of my favorite bosses as he was very challening whilst still remaining fun.</figcaption>

          alt="Picture of the bluelock season 2 blu-ray cover">

          alt="Omori box art">
        <figcaption>Omori has a very captvating story with great characters. The gameplay is decent, but the story
          is the best part as it is completely amazing.</figcaption>

          <img height="230" width="150" src="img/bocchirere.png" alt="Bocchi the Rock recap movie art">
          <figcaption>I really liked watching bocchi the rock as the comedy is expertly crafted and the music is peak.
            It got me back into playing Bass and makes me want to join a band.</figcaption>

            alt="Hoi4 cover art">
          <figcaption>Hearts of Iron IV is a ww2 grand strategy game. It is very complex and I have 600 hours on it and
            still don't really get how to play well. But it's very fun most of the time.</figcaption>
