        <h2>Learning IT</h2>
        <p>I have been learning about IT since elementary school when we started block coding on code.org. Since then I
          learned some HTML, CSS, and Javascript in class, and some C# on my own. I've also learned some other assorted
          IT skills not related to programming but they are a lot less concrete. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="column">
        <h2>Other</h2>
        <p>I like playing video games, going on walks/biking, watching anime/tv, and I hope to one day be fluent in
          german and also play soccer. Listed below are some of my favorite pieces of media.</p>
